# VirtualSlidingQWERTY
Hi!

This repository is to share our source code for a research called as "Virtual Sliding QWERTY" published in Applied Ergonomics journal.

Almost researches published in Ergonomics/Human factors research areas does not share their source codes of their prototype.
It makes difficult for researchers to compare performances like usability between the researches.
Thus, we open and share our source code used in our research.

Development language
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
- C#

Used hardware
- Microsoft Surface Pro 3 256 GB (however, any type of Windows based multi-touch support system will be okay)

Etc.
- Some texts in prototypes are written in Korean not English for the experiments.
- If needed, it will be corrected soon.

Referenced journal
- J. Cha, E. Choi, and J. Lim. (2015). Virtual Sliding QWERTY: A new text entry method for smartwatches using Tap-N-Drag, Applied Ergonomics, Vol. 51.
