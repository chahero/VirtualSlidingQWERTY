my watch fell in the water
breathing is difficult
we are having spaghetti
time to go shopping
a problem with the engine
my favorite place to visit
we run the risk of failure
love means many things
you must be getting old
the world is a stage
one heck of a question
beware the ides of march
the power of denial
i agree with you
do not say anything
play it again sam
the force is with you
you are not a jedi yet
an offer you cannot refuse
are you talking to me
yes you are very smart
all work and no play
hair gel is very greasy
valium in the economy size
the facts get in the way
the dreamers of dreams
did you have a good time
space is a high priority
do not squander your time
do not drink too much
take a coffee break
starlight and dewdrop
the living is easy
fish are jumping
the cotton is high
drove my chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
come and see our new car
i am going to a music lesson
the quick brown fox jumped
he is still on our team
we went grocery shopping
what you see is what you get
a quarter of a century
the store will close at ten
my favorite web browser
call for more details
just in time for the party
have a good weekend
the back yard of our house
this is a very good idea
our fax number has changed
thank you for your help
no exchange without a bill
buckle up for safety
this is too much to handle
mary had a little lamb
we accept personal checks
user friendly interface
the capital of our nation
gas bills are sent monthly
life is but a dream
fall is my favorite season
a fox is a very smart animal
the kids are very excited
my bike has a flat tire
do not walk too quickly
the four seasons will come
the sun rises in the east
it is very windy today
do not worry about this
dashing through the snow
want to join us for lunch
stay away from strangers
see you later alligator
make my day you sucker
i can play much better now
she wears too much makeup
my bare face in the wind
batman wears a cape
i hate baking pies
lydia wants to go home
freud wrote of the ego
i do not care if you do that
always cover all the bases
nobody cares anymore
can we play cards tonight
i watched blazing saddles
the sum of the parts
peek out the window
be home before midnight
toss the ball around
i will meet you at noon
i want to hold your hand
the children are playing
superman never wore a mask
he is shouting loudly
my dog sheds his hair
join us on the patio
the dog will bite you
where did you get that tie
what a lovely red jacket
do a good deed to someone
on the way to the cottage
do not drink the water
santa claus got stuck
zero in on the facts
make up a few more phrases
my fingers are very cold
rain rain go away
the price of gas is high
the winner of the race
we drive on parkways
we park in driveways
effort is what it will take
where can my little dog be
if you were not so stupid
do you like to go camping
this person is a disaster
you will loose your voice
are you sure you want this
this system of taxation
a yard is almost as a meter
we missed your birthday
i like to play tennis
you want to eat your cake
mystery of the lost lagoon
it looks like a shack
the dog buried the bone
the daring young man
i will put on my glasses
stability of the nation
you have my sympathy
very reluctant to enter
the minimum amount of time
the voters turfed him out
the union will go on strike
you should visit a doctor
the fax machine is broken
february has an extra day
do not feel too bad about it
he called seven times
that is a very odd question
no kissing in the library
sad to hear that news
one of the poorest nations
if diplomacy does not work
two or three cups of coffee
drugs should be avoided
the most beautiful sunset
we dine out on the weekends
a coupon for a free sample
we have enough witnesses
the bus was very crowded
the cream rises to the top
the location of the crime
quit while you are ahead
the trains are always late
sit at the front of the bus
do you prefer a window seat
canada has ten provinces
spill coffee on the carpet
with each step forward
wishful thinking is fine
what goes up must come down
the stock exchange dipped
that is a very nasty cut
find a nearby parking spot
do not lie in court or else
